# 📌 Release 2.2 – E-Commerce Exercise

This branch contains a small **E-Commerce simulation project**, designed to practice intermediate JavaScript concepts such as data handling, DOM interaction (if applicable), object structures, and basic business logic.

All fields and final results can be verified using the **console.log** output located at the end of the main file, allowing you to see all processed data clearly after a successful checkout, including product information in the cart and completed form details.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ✔️ Purpose of this Branch

The goal of this release is to practice how an e-commerce workflow operates internally, including:

- Creating and managing product objects  
- Handling prices, quantities, and cart operations  
- Processing totals and user information  
- Displaying results through structured console output after checkout  

This exercise prepares you for more advanced projects involving full UI manipulation, APIs, and complex data flows.
